## ðŸŽ¬ **Demo Script**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Hi, I'm Henry from Team Titan. We've built the Avalanche Yield Orchestrator - an AI-powered DeFi agent that's currently live on testnet and ready to revolutionize yield farming."

### **Live Demo (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Show the live testnet connection
pnpm run testnet

# Highlight these key points:
# 1. Real blockchain connection (<2 seconds)
# 2. Live data reading (blocks, gas prices)
# 3. Real yield opportunities found
# 4. Action simulation with real gas estimates
# 5. Network status and performance
```

### **Demo Talking Points**
- "Notice how quickly we connect to the real Fuji testnet"
- "This is live blockchain data, not mockups"
- "We're finding real yield opportunities across protocols"
- "Our safety system prevents any risky transactions"
- "This is production-ready code, not a prototype"

## ðŸ’¡ **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

### **Q: How is this different from existing solutions?**
**A**: Most solutions are either too basic (just APY comparisons) or too complex (require DeFi expertise). We provide AI-powered automation with built-in safety features, making yield optimization accessible to everyone.

### **Q: What about security and risk?**
**A**: We have multiple safety layers: demo mode default, transaction limits, health factor monitoring, and dry-run execution. Users can't lose money unless they explicitly configure live mode.

### **Q: How do you make money?**
**A**: Subscription tiers for advanced features, performance fees on successful optimizations, and protocol partnerships. We only charge when we actually generate value for users.

### **Q: What's your traction so far?**
**A**: We have a working product on testnet with real blockchain integration. Our code is production-ready and we're ready for mainnet launch in the next 30 days.

### **Q: Why Avalanche specifically?**
**A**: Avalanche has excellent DeFi protocols, fast finality, low fees, and strong developer support. It's the perfect ecosystem for yield optimization.
