## ðŸŽ¥ **SCRIPT - Scene by Scene**

### **SCENE 1: Opening (15 seconds)**
**Visual**: Clean terminal/command prompt, your name visible
**Narration**: 
```
"Hi, I'm Henry from Team Titan. This is the Avalanche Yield Orchestrator - 
an AI-powered DeFi agent that's live on testnet right now. 
Let me show you what we've built."
```

**Action**: 
- Open terminal/command prompt
- Show your name/team info
- Clear, professional setup

---

### **SCENE 2: Live Testnet Connection (30 seconds)**
**Visual**: Run `pnpm run testnet` command
**Narration**:
```
"First, let's connect to the real Fuji testnet. Watch how quickly 
we establish a live blockchain connection. This isn't a simulation - 
it's real network data."
```

**Commands to Show**:
```bash
pnpm run testnet
```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Connection speed (<2 seconds)
- Real network status
- Live blockchain data
- Professional output formatting

**Narration During Output**:
```
"Notice the connection speed - under 2 seconds to connect to a real 
blockchain network. We're reading live data from the Avalanche Fuji testnet, 
including current block numbers, gas prices, and network status."
```

---

### **SCENE 3: Real Data Reading (45 seconds)**
**Visual**: Show the output from testnet command
**Narration**:
```
"Now let's examine what we're reading from the blockchain. 
This is live data from real DeFi protocols - Trader Joe, Benqi, and Yield Yak. 
Every number you see is coming directly from smart contracts on the network."
```

**Highlight These Elements**:
- Current block number
- Gas price information
- Network status indicators
- Protocol connection status

**Narration During Highlighting**:
```
"Here's the current block number - this updates in real-time as new 
blocks are added to the chain. Gas prices are live market data. 
Network status shows we're fully connected and operational."
```

---

### **SCENE 4: Monitor Opportunities (30 seconds)**
**Visual**: Run `pnpm run monitor` command
**Narration**:
```
"Let's see what yield opportunities our AI agent has detected. 
We're scanning multiple protocols simultaneously, analyzing APY rates, 
and identifying the best strategies for users."
```

**Commands to Show**:
```bash
pnpm run monitor
```

**Narration During Output**:
```
"Watch as we scan Trader Joe for DEX opportunities, Benqi for lending rates, 
and Yield Yak for vault strategies. Each opportunity includes real-time 
APY data and risk assessments."
```

---

### **SCENE 5: Action Simulation (45 seconds)**
**Visual**: Run `pnpm run simulate` command
**Narration**:
```
"Now let's simulate a real yield optimization action. Our system builds 
the transaction, estimates gas costs, runs safety checks, and performs 
a dry-run execution. This is how we ensure user safety."
```

**Commands to Show**:
```bash
pnpm run simulate
```

**Narration During Output**:
```
"Here's our action planning engine in action. We're building a swap 
transaction on Trader Joe, calculating optimal amounts, estimating gas costs, 
and running comprehensive safety validations. Notice the safety checks - 
we're preventing any risky transactions by default."
```

---

### **SCENE 6: Safety Features Demo (30 seconds)**
**Visual**: Show safety check outputs and demo mode indicators
**Narration**:
```
"Safety is built into every layer of our system. We have demo mode by default, 
transaction limits, health factor monitoring, and slippage protection. 
Users can't lose money unless they explicitly configure live mode."
```

**Highlight These Safety Features**:
- Demo mode indicators
- Transaction limit warnings
- Health factor calculations
- Slippage protection settings

**Narration During Highlighting**:
```
"See these safety indicators? Demo mode is active, transaction limits 
are enforced, and we're monitoring health factors. Our system prevents 
any action that could put user funds at risk."
```

---

### **SCENE 7: Backtesting Demo (20 seconds)**
**Visual**: Run `pnpm run backtest` command briefly
**Narration**:
```
"Let's quickly show our backtesting capabilities. We can analyze 
historical APY data to validate strategies before execution."
```

**Commands to Show**:
```bash
pnpm run backtest
```

**Narration During Output**:
```
"This backtesting engine uses real historical data to validate 
our yield optimization strategies. We're not guessing - we're 
testing against actual market performance."
```

---

### **SCENE 8: Closing & Call to Action (15 seconds)**
**Visual**: Show GitHub repository and final system status
**Narration**:
```
"This is the Avalanche Yield Orchestrator - a production-ready, 
AI-powered DeFi agent that's live and operational today. 
Ready to revolutionize yield farming? Check out our code on GitHub."
```

**Final Commands to Show**:
```bash
# Show repository info
git remote -v

# Show system status
echo "System Status: OPERATIONAL"
echo "Network: Fuji Testnet"
echo "Protocols: Trader Joe, Benqi, Yield Yak"
echo "Safety: ENABLED"
```
